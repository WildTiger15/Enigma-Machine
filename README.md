# Enigma-Machine
The Enigma Machine project simulates the functionality of the historic Enigma machine used for encryption and decryption of secret messages during World War II. This project allows users to encrypt their text by simply downloading the provided files and placing their text in the Main.java file.

# Project Structure
The project includes the following files:

Main.java: The main entry point for the application. Users can place their text in this file to encrypt it.
Other supporting files and classes that simulate the components of the Enigma machine (e.g., rotors, reflectors).
Features

Encryption: Encrypt plain text using the Enigma machine simulation.
Decryption: Decrypt encoded text to retrieve the original message.

Customizable Settings: Modify rotor settings, reflector settings, and plugboard settings.
